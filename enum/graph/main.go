/*

Package graph is a simple package that provides facilities for creating simple
graphs where each Node is a particular value in an enum.

graph is useful for modeling adjacency of spaces in a gameboard.

NewGridConnectedness is a graph creator that connects all spaces in a grid that
are neighbors, with the ability to filter to only include some types of
neighbors.
