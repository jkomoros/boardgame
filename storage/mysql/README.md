Testing this package assumes that you have a MySQL server running at localhost:3306.

*WARNING*: a database named `TEMPORARY_DATABASE_boardgame_test` will be created and then dropped by this test. Ensure there's no real data in it!

# Connection strings

The connections trings that are passed to storage.Connect() are of a Data Source Name, described at https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name . 

Normally these strings contain the password, and so they shouldn't be checked
into source control. They are generally configured in config.SECRET.json, in the storageconfig section.

Currently the only db name that is supported is `boardgame`

A few examples:

Default for just a basic mamp installation

root:root@tcp(localhost:3306)/boardgame

An example of connecting in prod to a Google Cloud SQL service:

prod:PASSWORD_GOES_HERE@unix(/cloudsql/boardgame-159316:us-east1:prod)/boardgame

where the part after the /cloudsql/ can be derived from running `gcloud sql
instances describe prod`, and noting the connectionName in the result.  Full instructions for that string are here: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/go/using-cloud-sql


# Creating the database

The `boardgame-util db` tool is designed to help administer your database. 

To set up a database, configure the DSN as described above. Then, sitting in the same folder as config.SECRET.json, run `boardgame-util db setup` (include `--prod` if you want to run on the prod database.

# Making sure the database is up-to-date

Before doing a push to prod it's a good idea to make sure the database is set up correctly with the most recent changes since the last push. Run `boardgame-util db up` to make sure all migrations are applied.

# Updating the database structure

When making a change to the database structure, create two files in mysql/migrations, named `NNNN_<name-of-change>.down.sql` and `NNNN_<name-of-change>.up.sql` where `NNNN` is the next sequence number. (Don't forget to add them with `git add`)
