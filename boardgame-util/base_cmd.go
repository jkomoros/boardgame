		` is a comprehensive CLI tool to make working with
the boardgame framework easy. It has a number of subcommands to help do
everything from generate PropReader interfaces, to building and running a
server.

All of the substantive functionality provided by this utility is also
available as individual utility libraries to use directly if for some reason
this tool doesn't do exactly what you need.

A number of the commands expect some values to be provided in config.json. See
the README for more on configuring that configuration file.

See the individual sub-commands for more on what each one does.`
